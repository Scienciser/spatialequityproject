# spatialequityproject
Framework written in R to efficiently aggregate and map spatial equity data.  
Documentation is provided via Roxygen2.

A report was written describing the implementation and usage - read it [here](./report/compsci380_spatial_equity_project.pdf).  
A demonstration website was produced [here](https://scienciser.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/2e46471d956347bcb0a1de8465ad31d7).  The file that generated this data can be found at `scripts/processing.R`.
