	abstract = {Greenspace can have a significant positive effect on improved concentration duration, behaviour in the classroom, and educational and social development for school-aged children. This paper uses Geographical Information Systems to explore academic achievement and greenspace in New Zealand. Using multivariate linear regression, the association between greenspace exposure and the percentage of children achieving above academic attainment expectations was examined, controlling for gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic status was the most significant predictor of academic achievement. Weak associations between greenspace, academic achievement, gender, and ethnicity were observed. Unexpectedly, academic achievement negatively correlated with greenspace.},
